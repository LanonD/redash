## v1.0.0-rc.1 - 2017-01-31

This version has two big changes behind the scenes:

* Refactor the frontend to use latest (at the time) Angular version (1.5) along with better frontend pipeline based on
  WebPack.
* Refactor the backend code to use SQLAlchemy and Alembic, for easier migrations/upgrades.

Along with that we have many fixes, additions, new data sources (Google Analytics, ClickHouse, Amazon Athena, Snowflake)
and fixes to the existing ones (mainly ElasticSearch and Cassandra).

When upgrading make sure to upgrade from version 0.12.0 and update your .env file:

1. If you have local PostreSQL database, you will need to update the URL from `postgresql://redash` to `postgresql:///redash`.
2. Remove the `REDASH_STATIC_ASSETS_PATH` definition.

Make sure to make these changes before running upgrade as otherwise it will fail.

We're releasing a new upgrade script -- see [here](https://redash.io/help-onpremise/maintenance/how-to-upgrade-redash.html) for details.
